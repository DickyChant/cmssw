Description: A study of the associated production of a Z boson and a charm quark jet (Z+c) and a comparison to production with a b quark jet (Z+b), in pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV are presented. The analysis uses a data sample cor- responding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb$^{-1}$, collected with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC. The Z boson candidates are identified through their decays into pairs of electrons or muons. Jets originating from heavy flavour quarks are iden- tified using semileptonic decays of c or b flavoured hadrons and hadronic decays of charm hadrons. The measurements are performed in the kinematic region with two leptons with $p_T^l > 20$ GeV, $|\eta^l| < 2.1$, $71 < m_{ll} < 111$ GeV, and heavy flavour jets with $p_T^{jet} > 25$ GeV and $|\eta^{jet}| <2.5$. The Z + c production cross section and the cross section ratio are also measured as a function of the transverse momentum of the Z boson and of the heavy flavour jet.
